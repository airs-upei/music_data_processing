# Music Data Processing (Models Creation and Analysis)
Short Summary: This repo contains all the codes for our data processing and models generation (Models 0 - 4)

## Brief Background
During the several singing studies conducted in our Music Lab, we collected and conducted several analysis on the singing data of our research participants. Out of all the data collected, we paid the most attention to 20 tone sequences from the MAST-21 singing data. This repository outlines and explains in detail each of the analysis conducted as well as the models developed to solve some major problems we encountered during pitch analysis.

## Problem Definition
In our music laboratory, the analysis of pitches has always been important in understanding the musical abilities of our research participants. Traditionally, this pitch analysis has been conducted manually by human listeners who make use of the Praat software() to listen carefully to audio wav files produced from our lab's various research studies conducted. These files, which consists of different tone sequences sang by research participants, are closely looked at to find the ideal pitch in which a participant produced melodies fall in.

This type of manual analysis, while effective in providing detailed data can be very time-consuming, especially when the files are countles. Our human analyst must listen to each individual audio wav file, and then picking out the various pitch changes, and any noticeable patterns that might show. If you consider the huge quantity of audio data generated from our research studies, this process is really slow, and it prolongs our research process, possibly causing a delay in getting our research questions answered.

To address this problem and improve the efficiency of our research, we introduced an advanced pitch analysing software, pYIN into our singing programs, which has given us a new approach to how we analyse our data â€“ automated pitch analysis.

pYIN is basically designed to automatically analyse the musical pitches in an audio recording. While our participants perform their singing tests, the pYIN program steadily operates in the background, carefully analysing the pitches of the participants as they sing. Indeed, this solved our problem of automating our pitch analysis
